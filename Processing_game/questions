19. Difference between a for loop and a while loop:
For Loop: Typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of an initialization, a condition, and an increment/decrement statement.
While Loop: Used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. It continues looping as long as a specified condition is true.

22. Difference between parameters and arguments:
Parameters: Variables in a function definition. They act as placeholders for the actual values (arguments) that will be passed into the function.
Arguments: Actual values passed into a function when it is called. They correspond to the parameters of the function.

25. Difference between a class and an object:
Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors common to all objects of that type.
Object: An instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created from the class and has its own unique state and behavior.

26. What is a constructor function? What does it do and when?
Constructor Function: A special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It initializes the object's properties and performs setup tasks.
When: Constructors are used to ensure that objects start with a valid state and are commonly used to set initial values for object properties.

27. Why should each class have its own tab in Processing?
Reason: In Processing, each class should have its own tab to ensure proper organization and separation of code. It helps in maintaining a clear structure, making the code more readable and manageable.

31. Difference between an array and an ArrayList:
Array: A fixed-size data structure that stores elements of the same type. The size is defined at the time of creation.
ArrayList: A dynamic data structure that can grow or shrink in size. It is part of Java's collection framework and provides more flexibility than arrays.

32. Why would you want to go through a list backward, decrementing the index?
Reason: Going through a list backward can be useful when modifying the list during iteration to avoid issues with changing indices. Decrementing the index prevents skipping elements or accessing out-of-bounds indices.

37. When should you use PVector instead of float variables?
Use of PVector: PVector is used when dealing with 2D or 3D vector operations, such as representing and manipulating position, velocity, or acceleration. It simplifies vector math and provides convenient methods.

42. What is a normalized vector, why is it useful?
Normalized Vector: A vector with a magnitude of 1, indicating only the direction. It is obtained by dividing each component of the vector by its magnitude.
Usefulness: Normalized vectors are useful for representing direction without the influence of magnitude. They simplify calculations involving vectors and are often used in algorithms like physics simulations and graphics.
